The AiiDA framework allows users to rapidly implement workflows that can be executed both locally and on a remote cluster while keeping track of the full provenance of all generated data.
This section provides a basic introduction to how you can use AiiDA to implement and execute computational workflows.

.. note::

    Before you start, make sure that AiiDA is properly :ref:`installed <quick_installation>` and that all required services are up and running.

Implementing your first workflow
================================

For this example, we will consider the following computational task at hand:
