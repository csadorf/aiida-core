AiiDA doc file restructuring:

This is the current top-level (``) hierarchy of the aiida docs:

 * apidoc
 * backup
 * concepts
 * datatypes
 * developer_guide
 * get_started
 * images
 * import_export
 * install
 * nitpick-exceptions
 * querying
 * reference
 * restapi
 * savefig
 * scheduler
 * verdi
 * working
 * working_with_aiida

I propose to restructure the documentation to clearly follow the model outlined here (https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/) and also have the documentation source code hierarchy have this overall structure reflected:

 * install/       - Purely focused on installing the software.
 * tutorial/      - A minimal tutorial to get new users started (tutorial).
 * howto/         - Problem-oriented steps (how-to).
 * topics/        - Introduction to and more elaborate explanations (explanation).
 * reference/     - Information-oriented, accurate and complete (reference).
 * development/   - Information that is relevant only to developers (core and plugins).

This means we would need to roughly execute the following rearrangements:

 * apidoc -> reference/apidoc  // autogenerated, need to check if possible
 * backup -> howto/backup
 * datatypes -> reference/datatypes
 * developer_guide -> development
 * get_started -> likely to be moved to how-to
 * import_export -> howto/import_export
 * querying -> hotwo/querying
 * reference -> topics
 * restapi -> reference/restapi
 * scheduler -> reference/scheduler
 * verdi - reference/verdi
 * working -> topis/
 * working_with_aiida -> howto/ and topics/
